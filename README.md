Sklearn Learning and Practice

This is myself learning notes of sklearn.

I really enjoyed tsai tsai-sensei's presentation. 
The content is clear and easy to understand. Very easy to follow even for those who are completely new to machine learning.

The learning process is interspersed with explanations of mathematical principles, comparisons between models, practical applications and ideas, which I think is great.

I have replicated most of the code, including 90% of the case studies (a small part I didn't follow because I didn't get the source data).
After that, I will translate the more important material into English and add my own collated material to the notebook. 

I hope this will help more of my fellow learners.
